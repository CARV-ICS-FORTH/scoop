***************************************************************************

* Features in this version:

1) SAPRC'99 chemical mechanism.  See
http://pah.cert.ucr.edu/~carter/reactdat.htm for more information.  2)
Compile-time selection of data precision.  3) Updated discretization core.  4)
Automatic metrics collection and reporting via spreadsheet-suitable CVS files.
5) Compatible with all known C compilers.

* Tested domain sizes:

25x25: Transport only.  Double-precision only.  40x12: Chemistry and transport.
Both double and single precision.  640x192: Chemistry and transport.  Double
precision only.  1000x700: Transport only.  Double precision only.

* Known issues:

Chemistry doesn't work with IBM XLC compilers.

* Description of parameters (params.h):

FIXEDGRID is controlled via #define statements in $(TOPDIR)/config/params.h.
The idea is that someday this file could be generated by a more user-friendly
program, or another model.  The params.h file is a generally stupid way to pass
parameters to the model for a number of reasons, the least not being that a
human-induced mistake in this file breaks compilation (in the best case), or
induces strange runtime errors (in the worst case).  The following options are
available:

RUN_ID: Unique identifier for this run.  Can be any number from 0 to
MAX(uint32_t).

OUTPUT_DIR: Specifies directory to store output files in.

DOUBLE_PRECISION: When set to 1, data is stored as double-precision floating
point values.  Otherwise, data is stored as single-precision floating point.
Note: Chemical calculations are always done in double-precision.  Data will
still be stored as truncated single-precision floating point when chemistry is
enabled and double precision is disabled.

WRITE_EACH_ITER: When set to 1, concentration data for every monitored species
is dumped in MATLAB-friendly plain-text format into OUTPUT_DIR.  The filename
format is "OUT_solution_<species name>_<number processes>_<iteration>.<writing
process>".

DO_ROW_DISCRET: When set to 1, row discretization (i.e. x-axis transport) is
enabled.  Discretization is done at the precision specified by
DOUBLE_PRECISION.

DO_COL_DISCRET: When set to 1, column discretization (i.e. y-axis transport) is
enabled.  Discretization is done at the precision specified by
DOUBLE_PRECISION.

DO_CHEMISTRY: When set to 1, the SAPRC'99 chemical mechanism is applied to the
entire domain.  See notes on DOUBLE_PRECISION.

START_YEAR: Year to start processing.  Currently ignored.

START_DOY: The day-of-year to start processing.  Should be between 0 and 366,
inclusive.  

START_HOUR: The hour of the day to start processing.  Should be between 0 and
23, inclusive.

START_MIN: The minute of the hour to start processing.  Should be between 0 and
59, inclusive.

END_YEAR: Year to end processing.  Currently ignored.

END_DOY: The day-of-year to end processing.  Should be between 0 and 366,
inclusive.

END_HOUR: The hour of the day to start processing.  Should be between 0 and 23,
inclusive.

END_MIN: The minute of the hour to start processing.  Should be between 0 and
59, inclusive.

STEP_SIZE: Size, in seconds, of a time step.  The same time step size is used
for chemistry and transport processes, although this may (and probably should)
change in future.  Large steps may result in an unstable system.  50 seconds is
generally a safe, though compute-intensive, step size.

WIND_U_INIT: U-component (horizontal) of wind vector used to initialize domain
wind field.  Wind speed in meters per second (m/s).

WIND_V_INIT: V-component (vertical) of wind vector used to initialize domain
wind field.  Wind speed in meters per second (m/s).

DIFF_INIT: Initial turbulent diffusion value in square-meters per second
(m^2/s).

TEMP_INIT: Initial atmospheric temperature in Kelvin.

O3_INIT: Initial ozone concentration over entire domain in molecules per
square-meter (mol/m^2).

NROWS: Number of rows in the concentration matrix.  Equivalent to domain height
divided by cell height.

NCOLS: Number of columns in the concentration matrix.  Equivalent to domain
width divided by cell width.

DX: Width, in meters, of a cell in the fixed grid.

DY: Height, in meters, of a cell in the fixed grid.

SOURCE_X: Ozone source x-coordinate as a matrix column.  Must NOT be outside
the boundaries of the domain.

SOURCE_Y: Ozone source y-coordinate as a matrix row.  Must NOT be outside the
boundaries of the domain.

SOURCE_RATE: Emission rate for initial ozone plume.
